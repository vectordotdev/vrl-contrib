# VRL Contrib

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is new and experimental.

A community-driven repository of [Vector Remap Language (VRL)](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/) programs and examples for transforming, normalizing, and enriching observability data.

**Note:** VRL programs in this repository are community-contributed and not officially supported by DataDog maintainers. 
Always test programs in a non-production environment first.

## Overview

**VRL Contrib** is a central hub for sharing VRL programs that help you:

- **Transform logs** into standard formats like [OCSF](https://github.com/ocsf), [ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html), and more
- **Normalize data** from various sources (cloud providers, security tools, applications)
- **Enrich events** with contextual information
- **Parse and structure** unstructured log data
- **Learn VRL** through real-world examples

## ðŸ’¡ Example Use Cases

- Converting vendor-specific logs to open standards (OCSF, ECS)
- Normalizing multi-cloud logs into a unified schema
- Enriching security events with threat intelligence
- Parsing and structuring unstructured application logs
- Extracting metrics from log data
- Redacting sensitive information (PII, credentials)
